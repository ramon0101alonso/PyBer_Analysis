# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview. 
#### A ride-sharing summary DataFrame was created with Pandas to obtain total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type.  A multiple-line graph was then created for weekly city type fares during 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28.  

## Results: 
#### The chart below demonstrates the difference in ride-sharing data among the differnt city types.  The highest fares, total rides, total drivers, and total fares exist in the urban areas.  Suburban was second largest and Rural cities was last.   Urban areas did have the highes Average Fares per Driver and per ride.  There was a spike in rides close to the end of the month of Febuary for all driving areas.  Finally, the more drivers  in an area, the less the Average Fare per Driver.
